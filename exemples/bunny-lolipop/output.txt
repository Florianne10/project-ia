Generate a SHORT story about "A bunny eating a lolipop". Tell the story:


Once upon a time, in a sun-kissed meadow, there lived a little bunny named Benny. Benny was a happy bunny who loved to play and explore the world around him. One day, while hopping through the meadow, he spotted something that made his heart skip a beat - a bright pink lollipop!
Benny's eyes grew wide with excitement as he scampered towards the lollipop. He had never tasted anything so sweet in his life! With trembling paws, he picked up the lollipop and took a big bite. The sugary goodness melted in his mouth, sending waves of joy through his body.
As Benny continued to savor the lollipop, he felt himself getting sleepy. He curled up under a nearby tree, closed his eyes, and soon drifted off to dreamland. When he woke up, the sun was shining brightly overhead and the meadow was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. Benny smiled, knowing that the lollipop had made his day even more special.
From that day on, whenever Benny felt sad or stressed, he would search for a lollipop to remind him of the joy and happiness it brought him. And so, the little bunny lived happily ever after, with a smile on his face and a lollipop in his pocket."
