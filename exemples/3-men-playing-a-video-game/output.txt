Generate a SHORT story about "3 men : Floflo, Pierre and Nathan playing a video game". Tell the story:


Floflo, Pierre and Nathan were sitting in their living room, surrounded by pizza boxes and empty soda cans. They were deep into their latest gaming session, trying to beat the boss on their favorite video game. Floflo manipulated the controls with ease, while Pierre and Nathan provided backup with their rapid button mashing.
Suddenly, Floflo let out a cry of triumph as she defeated the boss. The other two men greeted each other, grinning from ear to ear. “Nice job, man!” exclaimed Pierre. “You’re a real player.”
But their celebration was short-lived, as they soon realized that their parents were standing in the doorway, looking at them with disapproving looks. “Boys, what are you doing?” » asked Mrs. Floflo sternly. "Don't you see how messy your room is? And why are you wasting your time playing video games instead of studying for school?"Floflo, Pierre and Nathan looked at each other nervously, knowing they were in trouble. They quickly turned off the game console and tried to make excuses, but their parents couldn't. “You need to set your priorities,” Ms. Pierre said firmly. “You’re going to bed now.”
As the three men walked up the stairs, they couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that their gaming session had been cut short. But they knew their parents were right: they needed to focus on their studies and not waste their time playing video games all day. They made a mental decision to be more responsible in the future and settled into bed with a mixture of shame and regret.
